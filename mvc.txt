MVC -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

MVC is a software pattern that separates the representation of information
from the user's interactions with it.

Model       - Classes which contain all of the business logic of the application
View        - Classes which format and present data to the user
Controller  - Classes which coordinate user actions and routing
