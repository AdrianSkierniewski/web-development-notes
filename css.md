Cascading style sheets

Include on a page like so:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/styles.css" media="screen">

Padding does different things, based on the number of entries you write:

    padding: 1;         // sets 1 unit all around (write as 1px, or 1pt, or 1em, etc.)
    padding: 1 2;       // top/bottom are 1, left/right are 2
    padding: 1 2 3;     // top is 1, right/left are 2, bottom is 3
    padding: 1 2 3 4;   // top is 1, right is 2, bottom is 3, left is 4

.class1.class2  - does something unique when an element has BOTH classes
