==================================
Trying to test HR dashboard via codeception.

I found out how to set a user in a codeception test. Call:

```php
    protected function setUser($username)
    {
        $model = Kalani\KDB\Models\User::where('username', $username)->first();
        Auth::setUser($model);
    }
```

I'm finding it easier to work with a single data source for dev and codeception tests. That may change, later, as we look at a larger picture. To do this, in app\config\local\database.php, I include:

    return array(

        'default' => 'codeception',

        'connections' => array(
            'codeception'  => array(
                'driver'   => 'sqlite',
                'database' => app_path() . '/tests/codeception/_data/db.sqlite',
                'prefix'   => '',
            ),

Interestingly, though, now all of my codeception tests are failing. 

When I attempt to go to a page, I get an error 'Trying to get property of non-object.' What is it looking for?

    @extends('templates/master')

    @section('content')
        <h1>{{ $repo->config('name') . ' List' }}</h1>

        <div class="console">
        <p><a href="{{route('objects.create', $repo->config('type'))}}">Create a new {{ strtolower($repo->config('name')) }}</a></p>
        </div>

    {{ DataTable::table()
        ->addColumn($repo->indexFields())
        ->setUrl(route('objects.table', $repo->config('type')))
        ->render('admin/tables/datatable') }}
    @stop

If I swap out templates/master with templates.blank, it works. Something with the master template, then... 

I tracked it down to this line:

    @include('admin/menu')

It looks like it's dying here:

    &nbsp;{{ Auth::user()->name }}&nbsp;

And, in User.php:

    return $this->person->first_name;

So, if I change that to `return 'foo';`, I now still have some failures, but no errors.

Some of the failures were caused by my new login method. I didn't log out after logging in...

```php
    protected function setUser($username=Null)
    {
        if ($username) {
            $model = Kalani\KDB\Models\User::where('username', $username)->first();
            return Auth::setUser($model);
        }
        
        Auth::logout();
    }
```

That's all good, now. How do we serve up different dashboard pages to different users?
