=================================
Working a bit more on a generator, and templates, this morning. Ideally, I would like to be able to run "generate", then go to a working app (even just a todo) within a few seconds.

Current template test returns 17 errors and 3 failures.

Mostly because the seeder file does not exist...

Next, lots of target not instantiable errors...

I can set up a service provider for them...

3 errors, 3 failures

A few touch-ups...

Right out of the box, I now get green tests.

Watching a start-to-finish tutorial on building an app...

* Do not start with model. Delay for as long as possible.
  This makes system more accepting of change.
* Start with view, degenerate scenario
  * simplest; lets you get system structure working
  * basic structure, routes, etc.
  * hard-code some html
  * route, controller, method, view (hard-code expected values)
* Scenario 2 is for variations
  * For early tests, create a struct/array with data...
* Introduce dynamism -- programming by wishful thinking
  (if this worked, it would be wonderful)
  * Modify the view for how you would like the data to be called
  * Build a dummy object in the controller (an array of them...)
* Moving code from test -> view -> controller

Interesting... He calls a presenter from a controller. 

Other interesting things:

* When testing, use a Given, When, Then structure
    Given: the initial state            (setup)
    When:  what happens to change it?   (method call, etc.)
    Then:  what should the result be?   (assertion(s))

Complexity should be extracted from the test objects and into helper functions.
