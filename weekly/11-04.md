==================================
I just figured out how to use PhantomJS with codeception, and it works well. Yay!

Install phantomjs (I put it in a folder on my path):

    http://phantomjs.org/download.html

Run it:

    phantomjs --webdriver=4444

Tell codeception to use it. In acceptance.suite.yml:

    class_name: WebGuy
    modules:
        enabled:
            [ Selenium2 ]
        config:
            Selenium2:
                url: 'http://lkata/'
                browser: phantomjs
                capabilities:
                    unexpectedAlertBehaviour: 'accept'

It even takes screen shots when something fails. Nice!

It's failing on something that it should succeed with, though. When I click an OK button on the login dialog box, the "login" message changes to "logout". That takes a few milliseconds. Can I tell it to wait, somehow?
