=================================
I'm getting to the point that I want to explore having different screens, elements, and objects for different people. This includes:

    * Different dashboards (unique dashboard per department)
    * Widget-level permissions and visibility
    * Item-level permissions and visibility

======================================
I only have a couple of hours at the moment. Let's play with PDFs...

There's a package called FPDF (and FPDI) at:

    http://www.setasign.com/products/fpdi/downloads/#files

Wait... that uses FPDF. FPDF is from:

    http://www.fpdf.org/

It works beautifully. This writes correctly formatted data to our reservation form:

```php
    < ?php
    require_once(__DIR__.'\fpdf\fpdf.php');
    require_once(__DIR__.'\fpdf\fpdf_tpl.php');
    require_once(__DIR__.'\fpdf\fpdi.php');


    // initiate FPDI
    $pdf = new FPDI();

    // set the source file
    $pdf->setSourceFile("Registration.pdf");

    // import page 1
    $tplIdx = $pdf->importPage(1);
    $size = $pdf->getTemplatesize($tplIdx);

    // add a page
    $pdf->AddPage($size['w'] > $size['h'] ? 'L' : 'P', array($size['w'], $size['h']));

    // use the imported page 
    $pdf->useTemplate($tplIdx);

    // now write some text above the imported page
    $pdf->SetFont('Helvetica', '', 12);
    $pdf->SetTextColor(0, 0, 0);

    $pdf->SetXY(65, 68.75);
    $pdf->Write(0, 'Guest Name');
    $pdf->SetXY(65, 75);
    $pdf->write(0, 'Contact Number');
    $pdf->SetXY(65, 81.5);
    $pdf->write(0, 'Date of Arrival');
    $pdf->SetXY(65, 87.75);
    $pdf->write(0, 'Date of Departure');
    $pdf->SetXY(65, 94);
    $pdf->write(0, 'Accommodations');
    $pdf->SetXY(65, 100.25);
    $pdf->write(0, 'Event');
    $pdf->SetXY(65, 107);
    $pdf->write(0, 'Deposit Received');
    $pdf->SetXY(75, 113.1);
    $pdf->write(0, 'Balance Due');

    $pdf->Output();
```

I'd like to be able to load an external font; not quite sure how to make that happen. Also, it would be nice to have all of this as a Laravel service, or even as something that can be loaded via composer.

======================================
Lots of possibilities today. It would be fun to play some more with that fpdf library -- maybe set up a psr-0 compliant version, installable via packagist.

That can be a deep rabbit-hole, though, and I already have plenty. :-)

Let's work on a view for a person. Once that's done, let's start working out details for a person (including links).

Or, go a bit deeper. I've been reading about hexagonal/onion architecture. Can I write something for a person based on that? What are my business rules? How can I codify those business rules?

Key tenets of hexagonal architecture:

    * The application is built around an independent object model.
    * Inner layers define interfaces; outer layers implement interfaces.
    * Direction of coupling is toward the center.
    * All application core code can be compiled and run separate from infrastructure.

I think I've been reaching toward this, but not really understanding it.

From http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html:

> The concentric circles represent different areas of software. In general, the further in you go, the higher level the software becomes. The outer circles are mechanisms. The inner circles are policies.

> The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is The Dependency Rule. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity.

An interface can be considered part of an inner circle. 

So, my RepositoryInterface objects can be used by inner circle, core objects.

Ahhhh... apparently, Object-Relational Mapping (eg, Eloquent models) and Domain Driven Design are somewhat contradictory. So, how do we use the good parts of each? There are some guidelines at http://www.udidahan.com/2008/06/25/object-relational-mapping-sucks/:

* No reporting  (eg, just use DB calls)
* Don't expose setters. ?????
* Grids are like reports

http://mortslikeus.blogspot.com/2009/01/active-record-and-ddd.html talks about a trap with Active Record. Basically, if you treat it as a data-store ONLY (no business logic at all), it works fine. When you start adding business logic to the Active Record types (eg, models), you start having problems:

> Most important, he violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP); the class is now responsible for multiple aspects:
> * Storing data
> * Executing business logic
> In the first few iterations, business logic that was previously packed in one method is now cluttered over multiple classes. DDD's supple design promises to mitigate that but a design usually only becomes supple by a lot of refactoring.

Does domain logic include relationships? That's something I really love about Eloquent...

http://geekswithblogs.net/gyoung/archive/2006/05/03/77171.aspx says that the foundation of DDD is the repository pattern. Internally, use the abstract contracts (*RepositoryInterface)
