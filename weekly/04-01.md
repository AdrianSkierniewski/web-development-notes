Learning a little bit more about git.

Configuration information is stored in these files:

    ~/.gitconfig          (global for user)
    project/.git/config   (local to project)

git add just adds changes (including in new files)

    git add .             (adds all files in directory)
    git commit -a         (stages all tracked files with modifications)
    git commit -m '<msg>' (commit everything with a comment; don't open editor)

Use a .gitignore file in a directory to ignore files and folders. List each type of file to be ignored. If you need to track specific files among ignored files, use a ! to disregard the ignore, and track those files:

    temp/*.txt              (ignore every .txt file in temp)
    !temp/important.txt     (track important.txt)

Parts of git:

    working directory       uncompressed files
    staging area (index)    lets you choose what to commit; good encapsulated messages
    git repository
