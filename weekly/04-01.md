Learning a little bit more about git.

Configuration information is stored in these files:

    ~/.gitconfig          (global for user)
    project/.git/config   (local to project)

git add just adds changes (including in new files)

    git add .             (adds all files in directory)
    git commit -a         (stages all tracked files with modifications)
    git commit -m '<msg>' (commit everything with a comment; don't open editor)

Use a .gitignore file in a directory to ignore files and folders. List each type of file to be ignored. If you need to track specific files among ignored files, use a ! to disregard the ignore, and track those files:

    temp/*.txt              (ignore every .txt file in temp)
    !temp/important.txt     (track important.txt)

Parts of git:

    working directory       uncompressed files
    staging area (index)    lets you choose what to commit; good encapsulated messages
    git repository          

git diff is used to see changes that have been made over time.

    git diff              difference between working directory and staging area
    git diff --staged     shows difference between committed and staged
    git diff HEAD         difference between working dir and HEAD (repository)
    git diff <hash> <file>  changes to <file> since <commit hash>
    
git log shows a history of commits over time

    git log               basic history of commits over time
    git log --stat        includes statistics  (files changed, insertions/deletions)
    git log --oneline     Shows each commit on one line  (hash, title)
    git log --graph       Shows graph of the current branch
    git log --all         Shows changes to all branches
    git log --decorate    Shows which branch the commit points to
    git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate   shows one-line graph of all branches
    git log --pretty='x'  Shows log with formatted output (which can be used elsewhere)
                          (see http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log for params) Examples:
                            %h   abbreviated hash
                            %t   abbreviated tree hash
                            %an  author name
                            %ad  author date
                            %ar  author date (relative)
                            %cn  committer name
                            %s   subject (commit message)
    git log --grep='x'    Limit output to those with log message matching regex

    alias gl='git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate'
    
    
Branches
---------

Master branch is there by default. Work on new, experimental features in new branches. You can switch branches at any time. When you commit, it will commit to the active branch.

    git branch              shows list of branches
    git branch <name>       create a new branch
    git branch -d <name>    delete the named branch
    git checkout <name>     swich to the named branch
    git checkout -b <name>  create and switch to a new branch
    git merge <name>        merge the named branch with the active branch
    git rebase <name>       rewind HEAD to branch point, apply branch changes, 
                            then replay additional changes to HEAD
                            (makes the log linear, so it looks like there was no branching)
