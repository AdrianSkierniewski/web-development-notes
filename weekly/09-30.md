==========================================
I just found out how `php artisan down` works. It creates a file called 'down' to app/storage/meta. If that file exists, you're in maintenance mode. Simple!


Web Site
------------
The web site is basically working in some simple ways, right now. I can add records easily enough. I'm thinking about using events, but haven't ever looked at them before, and don't really know how they work.

I tried putting this in several places...

```php
    Event::listen('eloquent.creating', function($event) {
        var_dump($event);
        Log::info('CREATING SOMETHING FOR JOEL!!!! --------------------');
    });
```

I've tried it in the App::before function in filters.php; I've tried it by itself in filters.php; I've tried it in a service provider; I tried adding it to the bottom of start/global.php and start/local.php. No dice.

Maybe it's the event that I'm looking for. This works (at the top of filters.php):

```php
    Event::listen('*', function($event) {
        if (is_string($event)) {
            var_dump($event);
        } else {
            var_dump(get_class($event));
        }
    });
```

Hmmm... It also works at the bottom of global.php, but not local.php. What events is it responding to? I'm trying to get the list, like this:

```php
    Event::listen('*', function($key, $event) {
        if (is_string($event)) {
            var_dump($event);
        } elseif (is_object($event)) {
            var_dump(get_class($event));
        } else {
            var_dump($event);
        }
    });
```

And, from that, I'm getting interesting output:

    string 'eloquent.saving: Kalani\KWeb\Models\Object' (length=42)
    string 'eloquent.creating: Kalani\KWeb\Models\Object' (length=44)
    array (size=2)
      0 => string 'P' (length=1)
      1 => string 'A' (length=1)
    string 'eloquent.created: Kalani\KWeb\Models\Object' (length=43)
    string 'eloquent.saved: Kalani\KWeb\Models\Object' (length=41)
    string 'eloquent.saving: Kalani\KWeb\Models\Page' (length=40)
    string 'called creating function...' (length=27)
    string 'eloquent.creating: Kalani\KWeb\Models\Page' (length=42)
    array (size=3)
      0 => string 'foo' (length=3)
      1 => string 'bar' (length=3)
      2 => int 81
    string 'eloquent.created: Kalani\KWeb\Models\Page' (length=41)
    string 'eloquent.saved: Kalani\KWeb\Models\Page' (length=39)
    array (size=1)
      0 => int 81
    string 'PagesController.store ok' (length=24)

So, I can see them. If I try listening for creating, or created, or eloquent.creating, though, I don't get anything. 

Wow! This worked, though!

```php
    Event::listen('creating: home', function($key, $event) {
        var_dump('CREATING FOR JOEL');
    });
```

And it also works with wildcards! I think I've got it!

```php
    Event::listen('eloquent.creating*', function($event) {
        var_dump('CREATING FOR JOEL');
    });
```

==========================================
I've spent some time today reorganizing the directory structure of the web site. Definitely loving TDD! If anything breaks, it pinpoints it immediately.

Now, working with a new way of handling DataTables. It seems to be fairly nice, and does a lot of things for me.

https://github.com/Chumper/Datatable

To make it work, I needed to include this in composer.json:

    "chumper/datatable": "dev-master"

This, in the providers array of app.php:

    'Chumper\Datatable\DatatableServiceProvider',

This, in the aliases array of app.php:

    'DataTable' => 'Chumper\Datatable\Facades\Datatable',

I have these routes:

```php
    Route::group(array('prefix'=>'node'), function(){
        Route::resource('pages', 'PagesController');

    Route::group(array('prefix'=>'api'), function() {
        Route::get('pages', array('as'=>'api.pages', 'uses'=>'PagesController@getDataTable'));
```

My PagesController object has standard CRUD methods, but also includes this:

```php
    public function getDataTable()
    {
        return DataTable::collection($this->repo->index())
            ->showColumns('id', 'title')
            ->make();        
    }
```

The PagesController::index method creates a view that includes this:

```php
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/datatables/css/jquery.dataTables.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/jquery.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/datatables/js/jquery.dataTables.js"></script>

    {{ DataTable::table()
        ->addColumn('id','title')
        ->setUrl(route('api.pages'))
        ->render() }}
```

(the javascript needs to be ABOVE the DataTable command)

And, boom! Good to go! There are a few issues with this. One is that it's not inserting links to the page. I think I can do that manually, though.

Next, I need to be able to capture events. How can I see if something is clicked on?

```js
    $('.dataTable').on('click', function(){
        console.log('clicked');
    });
```

That works when I enter it in the console, but not as part of my site. I suspect it's because it gets called before the dataTable object gets created...

In the view, you can setup your own custom layout. This is the default:

    DataTable::table->render($view = Null)
    // renders datatable/src/views/template.blade.php

Copy that file, and modify it as much as you'd like. For instance, these work, when put into an adapted view file:

```js
   $('.{{$class}}').hover(function() {
        $(this).css('cursor', 'pointer');
    });
    $('.{{$class}}').on('click', 'tr', function() {
        console.log($(this));
    });
```

Hmmm.... How do I get at the guts of an object? The first time that $(this) is called, it writes some nice things to the console, things I'd really like to pick up:

> [tr.odd, context: tr.odd, constructor: function, init: function, selector: "", jquery: "1.8.2"…]
> 0: tr.odd
>     _DT_RowIndex: 2
>     accessKey: ""
>     align: ""
>     attributes: NamedNodeMap
>     baseURI: "http://kweb/node/pages"

When I try to select it in any way, it gives me a much smaller object:

> <tr class=​"odd">​
>     <td class=​" sorting_1">​52​</td>​
>     <td class>​Guest Information​</td>​
> </tr>​

How can I get the more complete object? Ultimately, by capturing the mouse event...

```js
    $('.{{$class}}').on('click', 'tr', function(mouseEvent) {
        $id = mouseEvent.currentTarget.children[0].innerHTML;
        $url = mouseEvent.currentTarget.baseURI;
        document.location.href = $url + "/" + $id + "/edit";
    });
```

I'm now hitting the limits of what I know how to do in codeception. No idea how to test this one...




Wednesday, 2 October 2013
==========================================
I'm noticing that codeception is loading a lot of new data into my test database. Tests really shouldn't affect each other. Can I set it to re-load data?

I put this in codeception.yml:

    modules:
        config:
            Db:
                dsn: 'mysql:host=<host>;dbname=<db>'
                user: '<user>'
                password: '<pw>'
                dump: app/tests/codeception/_data/dump.sql

I also enabled the Db module in `acceptance.suite.yml`, then ran `codecept build`, to rebuild the WebGuy class. Run it again, and it's working. A couple of issues: first, it's much slower. Second, if I manually put something in for testing, it gets wiped out. I suppose I could use a different `dbname` value for codeception testing...

Changing the dsn to `dsn: 'sqlite::memory:` didn't work. It created a file called :memory: in my root directory, and couldn't pull in seeded data that I generated with mysqldump.

I created a database connection for codeception:

    'codeception'  => array(
        'driver'   => 'sqlite',
        'database' => __DIR__.'/../tests/codeception/_data/db.sqlite',
        'prefix'   => '',
    ),

How can I get dump data from that?
I can install sqlite on my computer (works in Linux; unknown on Windows)

    php artisan migrate:refresh --seed --database=codeception
    sqlite3 app/tests/codeception/_data/db.sqlite .dump > app/tests/codeception/_data/dump.sql

Yes! Much faster!

Problem: it runs it in a browser, so we don't know who's running it...

To make it work, we could pass an argument from the browser... Then this trick would work:

```php
    public function createApplication()
    {
        $unitTesting = true;
        $testEnvironment = 'testing';
        if(in_array('foo', $_SERVER['argv'])) {
            $testEnvironment = 'foo';
        }
        return require __DIR__.'/../../bootstrap/start.php';
    }
```

It will read all configuration settings from the foo directory.
Run phpunit with the foo configuration by entering:

    $ phpunit -d foo

Codeception might be able to work the same way...

I don't see it as an option, but that doesn't mean it's not possible.

Something in codeception sends the arguments to the server. It may be near the code I've already modified...

I'm having a problem with this installation in Windows, though. It's not running any tests at all. Returns "no such table" to everything. I wonder if it doesn't know the dsn, or what to do with the dsn... 

    dsn: 'sqlite:app/tests/codeception/_data/db.sqlite'
    dump: app/tests/codeception/_data/dump.sql
    user: ''
    password: ''

Hmmmm... Actually running a functional test, it's using the same connector as the tests connection. And, (known issue), it can't handle the :memory: database.

Can I change the connection, somehow?

Hmmmm... the Laravel4 driver module includes some interesting things. One thing, is that it sets         $testEnvironment = 'testing';
https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/blob/master/src/Codeception/Module/Laravel4.php

So, we're seeing the testing environment. What if the Db module writes the data to the file (which I'm pretty confident that it does), and then Laravel tells it not to use it? We need to be able to tell Laravel to use the provided file...

Hmmmm....

Depressed. It's not working. Maybe we revert changes and start over?

Maybe look at things the opposite way? I know that I can run an arbitrary environment name, testing from the command line, and I know how to do that. What if the standard was set to the sqlite location on disk, and I were to enter the :memory: version each time?

Or, just change the TestCase file in my tests folder to set $testEnvironment = 'test-foo';
