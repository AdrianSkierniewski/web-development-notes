Let's work on the shopping app as a kata...

These are equivalent:

    return Item::find($id)->vendors;
    return $this->data->find($id)->vendors()->get();        // data is an instance of Item
    return $this->data->find($id)->vendors;                 // data is an instance of Item

I'm not sure how to call an external web site from a laravel controller, so that I can use the results of that. 

Basically, I want to open 'http://api.shop/items', which will give me a json list of items. Then, I want to do something with that list in my controller (specifically, pass it to my view). I'd like to do as much processing as possible in laravel, not javascript.

One idea is to use cUrl...
There are also some additional libraries:

    Guzzle       "guzzle/guzzle": "~3.1"
    Requests     "rmccue/requests": ">=1.0"

Guzzle seems to be more complete, but it also has extra dependencies. I might be able to make do with Requests, which is very simple and clean:

    $request = Requests::get('http://api.shop/users');
    $users = json_decode($request->body);

    return View::make('admin/index')
        ->with('users', $users);

I want to use these icons in the pages:

  icon-chevron-down:  Indicate a sub-view that can be opened; click to open
  icon-minus:         click to close sub-view
  icon-ok:            (checkmark); create new record
  icon-edit:          clear the "new" form
  icon-remove:        delete the selected item

The pages look good. Let's see if we can add, edit, and delete records via ajax.

Each item has a delete icon next to it...
