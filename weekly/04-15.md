===============================

Getting wamp to return text/html for files with no extension...

Create a .htaccess file in the folder:

    DefaultType text/html

I'm starting a new instance of laravel, with all of the latest stuff.
As soon as I open it, we get some issues:

    ( ! ) Warning: require(C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\vendor\patchwork\utf8\bootup.utf8.php): failed to open stream: Permission denied in C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\vendor\composer\autoload_real.php on line 42

    ( ! ) Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required 'C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\vendor/patchwork/utf8/bootup.utf8.php' (include_path='.;C:\php\pear') in C:\wamp\www\active\lkata\vendor\composer\autoload_real.php on line 42

The unit tester passes, though. Not sure what's up with that. Maybe I really do need selenium... (don't want to run it each time, though...)


I'm also not sure how to fix this error.

ahhh... the file didn't have the read flag for others...

    chmod -R go+r *

I set up this class to test for xdebug errors:

    class SeleniumTest extends PHPUnit_Extensions_Selenium2TestCase
    {
        public function __construct()
        {
            parent::__construct();
            $this->setBrowserUrl('http://lkata');
            $this->setBrowser('chrome');
            $this->setHost('localhost');
            $this->setPort(4444);
        }

        public function testHomePageDoesNotIncludeDebugError()
        {
            $this->assertEquals(0, 
                preg_match('/xdebug-error/i', $this->source()), 
                'should not return an xdebug error');
        }
    }

Everything in this class will be slow to run.
The Way generators don't seem to be working at the moment, also...
Maybe it's just the combined (resource) generator.

Todo App
------------

I'm working on a quick and easy todo application today, just to practice techniques. TDD development.

Copy basic folders; composer install
Set permissions for the storage folder
Enter the selenium test; it's working now
Create a migration
Create a seeder
Create a database
Start testing and coding

The symfony web crawler is cool. We can determine if we have a specific div class in a document, using:

    public function testSampleItemIsInAnItemDiv()
    {
        $crawler = $this->client->request('GET', '/');
        $this->assertGreaterThan(0, $crawler->filter('div.item')->count());
    }

We can get information for children in the DOM chain, with:

    $children = $crawler->filter('div.item')->first()->children();
    echo $children->filter('h4')->count();
    foreach($children as $child) {
        echo($child->tagName);
        echo($child->getAttribute('class'));
        echo($child->nodeValue);
    }

I wonder if it would be possible to put a facade in for a test model, so we can mock it nicely, 'cause the existing setup isn't pretty at all.




Tuesday, 16 April 2013 
===============================

Interesting... I'm getting a failure due to no tests found in TestCase. I had to declare it an abstract class. Same with Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase

When we get to the controller tests, I get confused.

I can instantiate a new controller, and test it, like this:

    public function testTodoControllerIndexReturnsView()
    {
        $c = new TodoController;
        $result = $c->index();
        $this->assertContains('View', get_class($result));
    }

That works well, but it stops working once I start including a __construct function in my controller. 

I can open it in another way like this:

    public function testTodoControllerIndexIncludesData()
    {
        $result = $this->action('GET', 'TodoController@index');
        $this->assertContains('Illuminate\View', get_class($result->original));
        $this->assertViewHas('items');
    }

I can get the data passed in with:

    $result->original->getData();

One problem that I'm having is determining if the controller is being hit, or if something else is taking over. For instance, if I try to go to this:

    $result = $this->action('GET', 'foo@bar');

I still get an OK result, and data returned, based on my home controller. I want to make sure that my controller is there, and that it's running, and anything else should return an error.

    $result1 = $this->action('GET', 'TodoController@index');
    $result2 = $this->action('GET', 'foo@bar');
    $result3 = $this->action('GET', '/');

    var_dump($result1 == $result2);     // returns true
    var_dump($result1 == $result3);     // returns true

$result1 and $result3 are fine, but what I really want is $result2 to toss up some sort of error. It could be anything, really, to let me know that the controller action was not found (the controller itself should not be found). Honestly, even $result3 is questionable (it should really be called with $this->call('GET', '/')).

The TestCase action function does this:

    public function action($method, $action, $wildcards = array(), $parameters = array(), $files = array(), $server = array(), $content = null, $changeHistory = true)
    {
        $uri = $this->app['url']->action($action, $wildcards, false);
        return $this->call($method, $uri, $parameters, $files, $server, $content, $changeHistory);
    }

If I var_dump the $uri before the return call, I see this:

.string(1) "/"    // $result1 = $this->action('GET', 'TodoController@index');
NULL              // $result2 = $this->action('GET', 'foo@bar');
NULL              // $result3 = $this->action('GET', '/');

I want it to send an exception... One of these:

    ResourceNotFoundException
    RouteNotFoundException
    MethodNotFoundException
    MethodNotAllowedException
    MethodNotAllowedHttpException
    NotFoundResourceException(msg)
    NotFoundHttpException

In Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase.php#action (line 100), I'm entering:

    use Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\ResourceNotFoundException;

    if (is_null($uri))
        throw new ResourceNotFoundException(sprintf('Route "%s" not found.', $action));

I'll have to see if that can be submitted as a patch to Laravel itself, or if there's a better way to do it. In the meantime I can work with it.

So now, we can test a lot of things, using standard conventions:

    $result = $this->action('GET', 'TodoController@index');
    $this->assertContains('Illuminate\View', get_class($result->getOriginalContent()));
    $this->assertViewHas('items');
    $data = $result->getOriginalContent()->getData();
    $this->assertEquals(1, $data['items'][0]['id']);

To make that happen, I am returning information from an ArrayTodoRepository:

    class ArrayTodoRepository implements TodoRepositoryInterface
    {
        public function all()     
        {
            return array(
                array(
                    'id'            => 1,
                    'title'         => 'foo',
                    'description'   => 'bar',
                ),
            );
        }
    }

class EloquentTodoRepository implements TodoRepositoryInterface
{
    public function all()     { return Todo::all(); }
}

And now, I can create my Todo model...
And setup the database...

... and change the seed data, slightly, to see if I'm using the right thing...

Cool. At this point, we are getting data from two sources, but being able to address it exactly the same way. The two sources are:

    App::bind('TodoRepositoryInterface', 'ArrayTodoRepository');
    App::bind('TodoRepositoryInterface', 'EloquentTodoRepository');

Now, how can I make the default be EloquentTodoRepository, and the testing version be ArrayTodoRepository?

In a test function, I can re-bind it... And that works for one function at a time! Yes!!!! Now I have a (basically) in-memory test model. Yay!


Taking Credit Card Payments

I just saw a posting on #laravel about accepting credit cards via authorize.net. Interesting stuff:
