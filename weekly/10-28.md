================================

More codeception woes. I have this:

```php
    public function tryToLogIn(WebGuy $I)
    {
        $I->am('a general user');
        $I->amOnPage('/');
        $I->click('login');
        $I->fillField('Username', 'c1');
        $I->fillField('Password', 'test');
        $I->click('Log in');
        $I->see('logout');          // Not working
    }
```

Fairly simple stuff, but the last line isn't working. No problem at all during manual testing. It's also not dumping a file, so I can at least see what it's seeing. I'm using the ZombieJS driver.

Acceptance tests are using my actual database, which has the latest data; that shouldn't be an issue. (how to make them use the testing database???)

If I use PhpBrowser, instead of ZombieJS, it works fine. Ouch. I installed ZombieJS because I want to make this a single-page web app, and run a lot of ajax. Theoretically, ZombieJS can handle that, and PhpBrowser cannot. 

Let's think about something else for a minute. Try to use the test database...

In Codeception/Util/Connector/Goutte.php, we can set `$server['GOUTTE_ENV'] = 'testing';`

Then, we can find it with `\Request::server('HTTP_GOUTTE_ENV');`

Maybe not...

But `HTTP_USER_AGENT` (for ZombieJS) will contain 'Zombie.js'.

(for PhpBrowser) HTTP_USER_AGENT => Symfony2 BrowserKit

Looking at Twitter Bootstrap again. I'm really not understanding what's going on with it. I pulled a page directly from the example list, but it's not working. :-( It gives me one column, instead of multiples.
