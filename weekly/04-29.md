=================================

I'm preparing bootstrap editables for each form, one at a time. It seems to be working fine.

One issue that I'm running into now is handling the return from Laravel. When I return a 200 response (which should be OK), it still brings it up like an error. Not sure why...

It writes data to the server on line 216:

    $.when(this.save(newValue))
    .done($.proxy(function(response) {
        // this does not run, even when getting a 200 response
    .fail($.proxy(function(xhr) {
        // this runs...

Why is it picking up a success as a failure?

In query.js, line 8075, we have:

    if ( isSuccess )

which is returning false...
It seems to be doing that around line 8040...

    // if no content    
    if ( status === 204 ) {
        isSuccess = true;
        statusText = "nocontent";

    // if not modified
    } else if ( status === 304 ) {
        isSuccess = true;
        statusText = "notmodified";

    // If we have data, let's convert it
    } else {
        isSuccess = ajaxConvert( s, response );
        statusText = isSuccess.state;
        success = isSuccess.data;
        error = isSuccess.error;
        isSuccess = !error;
    }

At the very beginning, I get a parser error...

    ajaxConvert(s, response);

That function is on line 8186...
Oh! It's expecting a json response. Probably because I specifically told it that the dataType was json. Yup. Exactly. If I comment out the dataType (which I took to be the *send* datatype), I can even respond with '', as long as it's a 200 code, and we're good.
