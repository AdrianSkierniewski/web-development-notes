=====================================
Pulling Laravel 4.1

    git clone https://github.com/laravel/laravel.git mini
    git checkout -b develop origin/develop
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m 'Initial install'
    composer install

I'm wondering how to set up codeception to handle Given/When/Then terminology. Particularly, with regards to items sent to a controller. How can I have an array of items in Codecept, sent to the controller? How can I funnel test items to my controller?

CodeGuy has a haveFakeClass method. TestGuy doesn't, though...

Hmmm.... going for a while with broken tests...

Grrrr... There's a very early step, here, that I don't really understand. Ultimately, it leaves me stuck. It's very basic, too... going from "there are no items" to "there is one item". I don't want to have to create a database for that. I just want the test to push in one item, and let the controller work with that.

Unable to install mockery via composer. It's just frozen on the "Loading composer repositories with package information" step.

It looks like packagist.org might be down. :-(
