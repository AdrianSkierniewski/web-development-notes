================================
I've been studying working with domain objects, and letting questions about databases and frameworks and such wait until later. Yes, I think Laravel is great, but don't want to couple my domain to anything.

So, can we namespace a bare application? I think so... How do we get Composer to work without a framwork or any vendor dependencies at all? Just namespaces?

Tried installing composer, putting this in composer.json:

    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": {
            "BowlingGame": "src/"
        }

In phpunit.xml, I have:

    bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"

Which should, theoretically, let me autoload a class. But it's not working.

In my test, I have:

    use BowlingGame\Game;

    class BowlingGameTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        public function testGameExists()
        {
            $game = new Game;
        }

In the class itself:

    < ?php namespace BowlingGame;

    class Game
    {}

Why is it giving me a class not found error?

My Game object was directly in src, not in src/BowlingGame. Once I changed that, it worked. Incidentally, ending slashes are not needed for Composer.
