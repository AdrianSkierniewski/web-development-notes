=================================

I'm having some problems with git today. When trying to pull changes, it's giving me this error:

    $ git pull
    Username for 'https://github.com':
    Password for 'https://<>@github.com':
    You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
    want to merge with, and 'branch.autobuild.merge' in
    your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
    specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
    try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
    See git-pull(1) for details.

At home, I had some trouble uploading it, too. Not sure what's going on.

git remote show origin    shows local vs origin branches, in this format:

    * remote origin
      Fetch URL: https://github.com/jijoel/project.git
      Push  URL: https://github.com/jijoel/project.git
      HEAD branch: master
      Remote branches:
        autobuild tracked
        dev       tracked
        master    tracked
      Local branches configured for 'git pull':
        dev    merges with remote dev
        master merges with remote master
      Local refs configured for 'git push':
        autobuild pushes to autobuild (local out of date)
        dev       pushes to dev       (up to date)
        master    pushes to master    (up to date)

In this particular case, autobuild is set to push, but not to pull. How can I reset that?

    git branch --set-upstream autobuild origin/autobuild



Many to Many relationships in Laravel
---------------------------------------
Trying to get a many-to-many relationship with non-standard key fields. Basically, I'm wanting to use my oid field, rather than the id field, so I can link base objects together. In my Person model, I have this:

    public function addresses()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany('Address', 'object_addresses', 'address_oid', 'oid');
    }

Not working, though... Laravel will always use the defined key field. I could create another model for the same table, though. Maybe OPerson, or something.

    protected $primaryKey = 'oid';

... and do the same thing with addresses. 

I'm starting to think about when I want to use the simple ID, and when I want to use the OID...

Simple enough to manage. In BaseModel, include these:

    public static function findId($id, $columns = array('*'))
    {
        return static::findWhere('id', $id, $columns);
    }

    public static function findOid($id, $columns = array('*'))
    {
        return static::findWhere('oid', $id, $columns);
    }

    public static function findCode($code, $columns = array('*'))
    {
        return static::findWhere('code', $id, $columns);
    }

    protected static function findWhere($field, $id, $columns = array('*'))
    {
        $model = self::where($field, '=', $id)->first($columns);
        if( ! is_null($model) ) {
            return $model;
        }
        throw new ModelNotFoundException;
    }

I also tried a magic function, but it seems to be blocking something else important, so didn't work.
Ahhh... there are two separate magic functions:

    public static function __callStatic($name, $args)

    public function __call($name, $args)
    {
        // do stuff for this class...
        
        // Pass on to parent for more processing:
        return parent::call($name, $args);
    }
