============================

I'm trying to figure out how to include front-end libraries in my composer file. I found a composer package that will load some popular front-end libraries, including jquery, jqueryui, bootstrap, underscore, and font-awesome. It doesn't have some of the less-known packages, though.

Ideally, I'd like to be able to pull all of my component updates whenever I run composer update. I'd like to pull latest updates for these components:

DataTables
kineticjs
jquery-timepicker-addon
jquery-autosize

... probably lots more, too.


The composer package is:

Trying to set up a repository. This didn't work (and broke the composer update):

    "repositories": {
        "type": "package",
        "package": {
            "name": "jquery-autosize",
            "version": "1.17.0",
            "source": {
                "url":  "http://github.com/jackmoore/autosize.git",
                "type": "git"
            }
        }
    },
