===========================
I think I'm figuring out a functional way to test models. I have a test seeder and a production seeder; the test seeder has a short number of seeded values, just for testing.

A model can be broken up into several functional areas:

    * Accessors and Mutators
    * Relationships
    * Scopes
    * Other Utility Methods

It seems to me that (simple) testing can be done this way:

    * Accessors/Mutators:  Create a new object, set values, see results
    * Relationships: Check results from test seeded data
    * Scopes: Check results from test seeded data
    * Utilities: can vary

It would be nice to come up with some work-measurement tests. We have this set of tables; models need to be created for them, repositories, they need seeds, etc.
