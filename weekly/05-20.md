Real-Time Push Notifications
==============================

I'm learning how to do real-time push notifications in html.

These would be useful for updating comments as they happen, posting alerts, and so on.

See:

Several external services do this, too:

    Pusher: pusher.com
    Realtime: http://www.xrtml.org/
    Beaconpush: http://www.beaconpush.com/

HTML5 introduced websockets, which do this.
