===============================

Trying Laravel 4.1. Very strange... My initial response is just a blank screen. No errors, no nothing.

Tracing to Application::run...
Tracing through some more...

I can just catch an exception in index.php...

    try {
        $app->run();
    }
    catch (\Exception $e) {
        var_dump($e);
    }

It throws an exception, but doesn't do the nifty exception handling I'm used to.
The exception is just a permission denied to save a session. Why isn't it showing nice exception handling?

=================================

I'm trying to imagine how to put objects together, based on everything I've been learning about clean code. It seems to use a lot of classes. We would have:

### MVC (Pure application space)
route
Controller

### Adapter / Service layer (Mixed application/domain)
Adapter / Principle Interactor (funnels things to appropriate use cases)
Validator
Authentication / Permissions Service

### Domain Layer
Person (for instance; all entities)

### Adapter / Service Layer
Person Repository  (Repository for each entity type)

### MVC (application space)
Person Model
Eloquent
Person / related tables

Am I making things too complicated? Is that what is needed in a big system? How does that interact with things like dashboards? I know that I want to be able to give anyone an address, and they'll get a page/object that conforms to their level of access. (eg, some people might get a person object, but not be able to edit it; others would be able to edit; others to delete).

I got completely lost on the Interface Segregation Principle...

...

Each use-case module should be responsible to one and only one actor.

In the example, he creates a use-case factory, and a request builder, both used by the controller. Confused....

Use case factory: make method (with use case name)
Request Builder:  build method (with request name and constructor arguments)
