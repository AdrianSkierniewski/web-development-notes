===============================

Trying Laravel 4.1. Very strange... My initial response is just a blank screen. No errors, no nothing.

Tracing to Application::run...
Tracing through some more...

I can just catch an exception in index.php...

    try {
        $app->run();
    }
    catch (\Exception $e) {
        var_dump($e);
    }

It throws an exception, but doesn't do the nifty exception handling I'm used to.
The exception is just a permission denied to save a session. Why isn't it showing nice exception handling?
