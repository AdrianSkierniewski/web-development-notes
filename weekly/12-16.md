===============================

Trying Laravel 4.1. Very strange... My initial response is just a blank screen. No errors, no nothing.

Tracing to Application::run...
Tracing through some more...

I can just catch an exception in index.php...

    try {
        $app->run();
    }
    catch (\Exception $e) {
        var_dump($e);
    }

It throws an exception, but doesn't do the nifty exception handling I'm used to.
The exception is just a permission denied to save a session. Why isn't it showing nice exception handling?

==================================

Trying hard to learn how to get a complex system working...

* There should be a 1-1 relationship between use cases and objects representing them (Interactors)
* Interactors implement application-specific business rules
* Interactors can know about Entities (business objects)
* Client (eg, MVC layer) sends Request Model (data-transfer object) to Interactor
* Interactor returns a Result Model (data-transfer object) back to the client

* Classes are nouns; functions start with verbs

It seems, then, that we would have these categories of classes for pretty much everything:

    View (index, create, show, edit)    Laravel/Blade
    Controller                          Laravel (extends BaseController)
    Adapter                             Boundary (knows Laravel and domain objects)
    Interactor                          Domain (implements use-cases; application level)
    Entity                              Domain (enterprise rules)
    RepositoryInterface                 Domain
    Repository                          Boundary (knows Laravel objects)
    Model                               Laravel/Eloquent
