git:

Basic Usage
To create a new local repository:
    git init      // Initialize a new git repository
    git remote add origin https://github.com/jijoel/project.git

To copy a remote repository to the local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/jijoel/project.git local_project_dir

To use git to send files to a remote repository:
    git add *     // Add all files in the path on the local machine to the track list
    git commit    // Commits changes to the local repository
    git push      // Pushes changes to the remote repository
    
To pull working files from the repository (eg, to get updates from other people or other places that have been pushed to the remote repository)
    git pull      // Pull (and merge) changes from the remote repository
or
    git fetch
    git merge

To see what has changed in the working tree
    git status


Advanced Usage
Pull data from a remote repository, wiping out any local changes:
    git reset --hard HEAD
    git pull

If you have local commits that you'd also like to wipe out:
    git reset --hard origin/master
    git pull
    
Configuration:
Use the nano editor for commits
    git config --global core.editor "nano"
